      "The output is used to indicate relative humidity. The term humidity means the amount of \n",

      "humidity and this principle is used in hygrometer for measurement. \n",
      "The humidity is classified into two types. \n",
      " Absolute Humidity \n",

      "force on the rotor and the very next instant it will be N-S causing attractive force. But due to \n",
      "the inertia of the rotor, it is unable to rotate in any direction due to that attractive or repulsive \n",
      "force, and the rotor remains in standstill condition.  \n",

      "CONCLUSIONS \n",
      "The basic principle of working of resistive, capacitive and inductive sensors and \n",

      "unit Hydraulic, pneumatic and electric actuators were thoroughly mentioned. Miniaturized \n",
      "sensors and actuators working principle and applications were seen.  \n",
      "Surface properties of the material can affect the efficiency and behaviour of the \n",
      "material when in service. Modifying and tuning these surface properties to meet the specific \n",
      "demand for better performance is feasible and has been vastly employed in a different aspect \n",
      "of life. This can be achieved by coating the surface via deposition of the thin film. The fifth \n",
      "unit of this study material provides a review of the existing physical vapour deposition \n",
      "techniques used for surface modification and coating. The area of applications of surface \n",
      "coating was briefly highlighted in this note. The sputtering and LIGA technique is discussed \n",
      "and the comparison between evaporation techniques was explained. \n",
      "Sensors and actuators are increasingly being used for many technical applications. A \n",
      "sensor is a vital organ of an artificial system, forming the interface between the controller and \n",
      "the environment. Sensors can smell, taste, see and feel by measuring mechanical, \n",
      "biochemical, thermal, magnetic and radiation parameters. Actuators are mainly used in \n",
      "medical and industrial purpose. Using MST technology, sensors and actuators are \n",
      "manufactured in miniaturized size well suited for various applications. Micro sensors have \n",
      "high reliability, low weight and volume, and low mass-production cost makes it suitable for \n",
